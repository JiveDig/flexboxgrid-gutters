# Flexbox Grid Gutters
A modified version of [flexboxgrid.com](http://flexboxgrid.com/). This version has smaller column widths to proved gutters
Grid based on the flex display property.

## Known bug/issue 
If last row doesn't have enough elements (while using `between-*` class) the elements in that row have a space between.

## How To Use
Please see [flexboxgrid.com](http://flexboxgrid.com/) for usage. All classes are the same.
Search and replace percentage widths from [this grid column generator](http://thestizmedia.com/grid-column-generator/) if you want to change from defaults.

## What's Different?
This version has reduced percentage widths to allow natural gutters between columns.
