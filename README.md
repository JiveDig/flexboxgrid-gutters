# Genesis Flexbox Grid
A modified version of flexboxgrid.com
Grid based on the flex display property.

## How To Use
Please see flexboxgrid.com for usage. All classes are the same. 

## What's Different?
This version has reduced percentage widths to allow natural gutters between columns.

Some widths are missing since Genesis doesn't support the 1200 grid by default
