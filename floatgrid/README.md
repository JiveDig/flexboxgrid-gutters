# Float Grid
A modified version of bootstrap v3.x grid.

## How To Use
Add a class for each of the 4 breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg) to a container element to declare the total columns out of the 12.
Example container: `<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3">`.
Add a class of `.col` to each immediate child element that is part of the column grid.

## Modify
Search and replace percentage widths from [this grid column generator](http://thestizmedia.com/grid-column-generator/) if you want to change from defaults.
